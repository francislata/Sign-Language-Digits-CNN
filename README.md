# Sign Language Digits - CNN

## Description
This project is about using the [Sign Language Digits Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset/data) to classify images
of sign language digits. This is similar to the MNIST dataset that has been used throughout the years to classify a grayscale, handwritten digits
between 0 to 9.

## Goal
The idea behind this project is to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify a sign language digit image to a digit between 0 to 9.
Since CNN's have been proven effective when working with pixels of images as its inputs, it will be interesting exploring various architectures of CNN
models that works best for this dataset.

Furthermore, this demonstrates how I approach designing of a learning model and its development. I will outline the designs I have considered and evaluating
their performance in this dataset.

## About the dataset
This dataset has been provided by **Turkey Ankara AyrancÄ± Anadolu High School** and I have found this dataset through Kaggle. The images are converted
to grayscale images of size 64 x 64.

## Technologies used
In this project, I will be using **Python** as the programming language of choice. Also, I will use the **Keras** framework to create the layers of the CNN model.

## Credits
The dataset and its original source can be found through Kaggle's website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset/data).
